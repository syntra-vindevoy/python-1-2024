"""
Write a function that reads the words in words.txt and stores them as keys in a dictionary. It doesnâ€™t matter what the values are. Then you can use the in operator as a fast way to check whether a string is in the dictionary.

If you did Exercise 10, you can compare the speed of this implementation with the list in operator and the bisection search.
