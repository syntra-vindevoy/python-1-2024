In Python, mutable data structures like lists, sets, and dictionaries can contain mutable elements. However, certain operations and constraints apply:

1. **Lists**: Lists can contain mutable elements, including other lists, dictionaries, and sets.
2. **Dictionaries**: Dictionaries can have mutable values but keys must be immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples, frozensets).
3. **Sets**: Sets cannot contain mutable elements directly because elements of a set must be hashable. This means you cannot have a set of sets, but you can have a set of frozensets.

Here's a summary:

- **Lists**: Can contain mutable elements.
- **Dictionaries**: Keys must be immutable, values can be mutable.
- **Sets**: Elements must be immutable (hashable).


In your function, you use 

frozenset

 to make the inner sets hashable so they can be contained within an outer set.

# Sets cannot contain mutable elements directly
# set_of_sets = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}}  # This will raise a TypeError
set_of_frozensets = {frozenset({1, 2}), frozenset({3, 4})}  # This is allowed
