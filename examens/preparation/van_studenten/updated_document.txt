### **Integrating Files with Strings**
10. **Basic:**
    - Write a program to read a file `paragraph.txt` and:
      - New Count the number of characters in the file.
      - New Count the number of sentences (assume sentences end with `.`).
      - New Count the number of words.

11. **Intermediate:**
    - Write a Python program to search for a specific word in a file `document.txt` and:
      - New Count how many times the word occurs.
      - Replace all occurrences of the word with another word and save the updated content to a new file `updated_document.txt`.

12. **Advanced:**
    - Write a Python program that reads a file `log.txt` containing log entries in the format:
      ```
      2025-01-01 INFO Starting application
      2025-01-01 ERROR Failed to connect
      2025-01-02 INFO Process completed
      ```
      - Extract and count the number of log entries for each level (`INFO`, `ERROR`, etc.).
      - Save the counts to a file `log_summary.txt`.
