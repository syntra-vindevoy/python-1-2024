    Calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer.

    The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted as n!,
    is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
    If x is 0 or 1, the function returns 1. If x is a positive integer,
    it computes the factorial iteratively. If x is negative, the function
    returns 0.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : int
        A non-negative integer for which the factorial is to be computed.

    Returns
    -------
    int
        The factorial of x if x is non-negative; otherwise, returns 0.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> fac2(x=5)
    120
    >>> fac2(x=0)
    1
    >>> fac2(x=-3)
    0
