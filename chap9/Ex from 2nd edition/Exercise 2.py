# Write a function called cumsum that takes a list of numbers and returns the cumulative sum;
# that is, a new list where the ith element is the sum of the first i+1 elements from the original list. For example:
# >>> t = [1, 2, 3]
# >>> cumsum(t)
# [1, 3, 6]

def cumsum(l: list) -> int:
    for element in l:
