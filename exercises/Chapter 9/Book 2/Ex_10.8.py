# Exercise 10.8.
# This exercise pertains to the so-called Birthday Paradox,
# which you can read about at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_paradox.
# If there are 23 students in your class, what are the chances that two of them
# have the same birthday? You can estimate this probability by generating random
# samples of 23 birthdays and checking for matches.
# Hint: you can generate random birthdays with the randint function in the random module.
