while <bool condition>:

    code
    change <bool condition>


while a < 5:
    fdfdfdf
    ddfdfdf
    a += 1

You can jump out of the while when:
- bool condition is not met anymore
- return (can only be used inside a function
    - return jumps out of the function (not only the while)
    - lower code in the function will NOT be executed
- break: stops the execution of the while, the rest of the function code is still executed
    - can also be used outside of a function
- continue:
    - doesn't jump out of the while loop
    - jumps back to the start of the while loop and checks the bool condition
    - code below the continue is NOT executed anymore

for an infinite while:
while True:
    fdfdfd
    dfdfdf
    dfdfdf
